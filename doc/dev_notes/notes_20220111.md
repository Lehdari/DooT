Status Update
=============
Hyrtsi:
- Implemented VPG (vanilla policy gradient)
    - Simple stateless model consisting of conv / dense layers
    - Living reward

Lehdari:
- Read / watched materials, trying to understand the fundamental problem
    - Inspired by concepts introduced in JEPA

Ideas / discussion
==================
- Memory?
    - Long sequences of frames
        - Most likely not feasible due to the hardware constraints
        - Encoding of frames most likely required
- Quality of current encoder
    - Are the encoded properties useful for the RL model(s)?
    - Introduction of a test set (current visualizations are for training data)
    - Current model trained with 8 512-long sequences
        - Training with infinite dataset
- Ideas regarding global world model
    - Observation model making observation predictions from updated world state and action
- Forking GZDoom
    - ViZDoom a bit limited
        - Implementing custom functionality
    - Performance
        - Native data structured
        - Threading

Action plan
===========
Hyrtsi:
- Further experiments on the phone booth map
    - Experiment on using the current encoder network
    - More advanced RL algorithms

Lehdari:
- GZDoom investigations
