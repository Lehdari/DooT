Previous goals:
===============
- Training long sequences until exit
    - Increasing map complexity gradually
        - Initially no doors, elevation, monsters
    - Use N-length sequence before exit (final frame contains exit)

- Obtaining training data
    - Random walkers will eventually find exit

- Initially train encoder (-decoder) model
    - Compress images into latent space representation (length 2048 for now)

Previous achievements
=====================
- Grid search on several architetures and training parameters
    - Outcomes:
        - Default training parameters seem to perform best (most reliably on different hyperparameters)
        - Both deepening and widening the network will increase the performance
- Flow model for 

Considerations
==============
- Encoder should create coherent encodings in latent space
    - Will the data produced by random walker be useful for agent training?
- How to ensure encoder model sufficiency?
    - In case of failure, how to proceed?
        - Debugging?
